#### ESC Project (Routing Part)

---

This handles the entire Routing backend. 
This was cloned from my teammate's Github. https://github.com/teckleck19/ESC_Project
ie: Which agent is free, skilled in what, which customer is queued up and what request does the customer have etc.

To run this, kindly run npm start. 

The test.js and test2.js are the different testing files.
